# TANDEMLOOP Programming Test (Python)

This repository contains solutions to a programming test consisting of four problems. The test is designed to assess your problem-solving and coding skills. Please follow the instructions below to complete the test.

## Problem 1: Calculator

**File:** `Problem-1.py`

**Description:** Implement a small calculator class that performs operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator should take inputs `a` and `b` of type `double` and the type of operation as a string. The calculator should be able to perform the requested operation and return the result.

## Problem 2: Number Series 1

**File:** `Problem-2.py`

**Description:** Given an integer `x`, the program should generate a series of numbers starting from 1 and continuing until reaching `x`. Each number in the series should be incremented by 2.

## Problem 3: Number Series 2

**File:** `Problem-3.py`

**Description:** Given an integer `x`, the program should generate a series of odd numbers starting from 1 and continuing until reaching `x`.

## Problem 4: Count of Numbers

**File:** `Problem-4.py`

**Description:** Given a list of numbers, the program should count the total occurrences of numbers that are multiples of the numbers 1 to 9. The output should be a dictionary where the keys are the numbers 1 to 9, and the values are the corresponding counts.
